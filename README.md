## Hello all!

I am currently learning Github as a level 3000 dark lord.
My current work is the digital afterlife.
Ask me about the physical-digital transition and technilogical symbiosis.
Fun Fact: When singularity is acheived, nanobots will spiral out of control and suck all carbon-based life forms into oblivion within a matter of hours to days.
